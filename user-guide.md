# User guide for Restaurant App
- If you are viewing the restaurants and you would like to choose "make a reservation" at one of them, you can click on the "Select Table" button underneath the restaurant card itself.
- If you are viewing the restaurants but want to narrow down your choices you may enter a zip-code in the search bar at the top of the screen and see which restaurants are located in that area.
- Once you have selected a restaurant and are viewing the seating chart of the restaurant, you may select whichever table you like. Each restaurant has a variety of tables that you can choose from. 
- Once you have selected a table of your choice, by pressing the "SELECT" button, a random code will appear that you can show to the host once you have arrived at the restaurant.
